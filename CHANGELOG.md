# dbt_instagram_business v1.0.0

[PR #23](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_instagram_business/pull/23) includes the following updates:

## Breaking Changes

### Source Package Consolidation
- Removed the dependency on the `fivetran/instagram_business_source` package.
  - All functionality from the source package has been merged into this transformation package for improved maintainability and clarity.
  - If you reference `fivetran/instagram_business_source` in your `packages.yml`, you must remove this dependency to avoid conflicts.
  - Any source overrides referencing the `fivetran/instagram_business_source` package will also need to be removed or updated to reference this package.
  - Update any instagram_business_source-scoped variables to be scoped to only under this package. See the [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_instagram_business/blob/main/README.md) for how to configure the build schema of staging models.
- As part of the consolidation, vars are no longer used to reference staging models, and only sources are represented by vars. Staging models are now referenced directly with `ref()` in downstream models.

### dbt Fusion Compatibility Updates
- Updated package to maintain compatibility with dbt-core versions both before and after v1.10.6, which introduced a breaking change to multi-argument test syntax (e.g., `unique_combination_of_columns`).
- Temporarily removed unsupported tests to avoid errors and ensure smoother upgrades across different dbt-core versions. These tests will be reintroduced once a safe migration path is available.
  - Removed all `dbt_utils.unique_combination_of_columns` tests.
  - Removed all `accepted_values` tests.
  - Moved `loaded_at_field: _fivetran_synced` under the `config:` block in `src_instagram_business.yml`.

- `*_views` will replace `*_impressions`, but since the metrics are not exactly identical, weâ€™ve kept them separate rather than coalescing them. For more context, see [this decision log entry](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_social_media_reporting/blob/main/DECISIONLOG.md) from the `dbt_social_media_reporting` rollup package.
  - Note: In the rollup package, we do coalesce `*_views` and `*_impressions` fields to simplify downstream use.

## Updates
- Applied schema changes to align with the [April 2025](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/applications/instagram-business/changelog#april2025) and [December 2024](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/applications/instagram-business/changelog#december2024) Fivetran connector updates:
    - Deprecated metrics are retained for backward compatibility but will be removed in a future release.
    - Refer to the [Instagram API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/reference/instagram-media/insights) for more context on updated fields.

## Documentation
- Added definitions for newly introduced fields.
- Marked deprecated fields accordingly.
- Added Quickstart model counts to README. ([#16](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_instagram_business/pull/16))
- Corrected references to connectors and connections in the README. ([#16](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_instagram_business/pull/16))

# dbt_instagram_business v0.1.0

The original release! The main focus of the package is to transform the core social media object tables into analytics-ready models that can be easily unioned in to other social media platform packages to get a single view. This is especially easy using our [Social Media Reporting package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_social_media_reporting).
